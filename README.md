  My first take at browser chatApp made in React and Firebase. I'm trying to make this up with a "mobile-first" approach. This project is still in production and there are many parts that need overhaul.
  
 Goal features of this project:
-public chatrooms with live message feedback
-searching and hosting chatrooms
-user profile management (e.g. nickname, profile picture, friend list)
-responsive layout
-desktop and mobile version
